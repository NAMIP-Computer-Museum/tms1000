# Curated resources about TMS 1000 microcontroller and handheld games/calculators

This project contains a curated list of resources related to the TMS 1000 early 4 bits microcontroller 
for Texas Instruments and a number of devices, mostly handheld games from the 1970's and early 1980's

With also original material/utilities/guides for specific devices such as the Little Professor
